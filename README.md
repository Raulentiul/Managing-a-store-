Each product sold in the store is described by the following information: a unique code, a name, a price, quantity in stock, date of production, date of expiration.

In the main function, I run 6 tests:
1. list all products
2. list valid products (which are not expired at a given date)
3. list expired products (at a given date)
4. finding a product based on its code, and being able to update the product.
5. delete a product based on its code.
6.delete all expired items

The products are ordered by their prices.

I've created this code using linked-lists.
